## Sections
The website has five main sections: Home, About Me, Projects, Certificates, and Contact Me. Each section follows a similar structure consisting of text content and images. However, the content in these sections is currently populated with placeholder data and images. It is recommended to replace this with actual information and project details.

## Footer
The footer is divided into four parts. The first part briefly mentions Mayank's profession as a Data Analyst. The second, third, and fourth parts consist of links, but these currently say "home" and should be updated with relevant links or removed if not needed. 

## Scripts
The portfolio uses two JavaScript files: 
- `typed.js`: This script is used to create typing animation, likely for the introductory section.
- `script.js`: This script is custom and may include additional interactivity or functionality for the website.

## Conclusion
Mayank Garg's portfolio provides a simple and clean introduction to his skills and background as a web developer and data analyst. To make it more informative and engaging, it's recommended to replace the placeholder content with real data and projects. Additionally, ensure that the links and scripts are functional and serve their intended purposes.
